This folder contains the 2024 PMT LIME analysis.

This includes: 3D; PMT-CAM association; Longitudinal diffusion studies, alpha analysis, and other small comparison with Camera data.

I will start with the Americium dataset since we should have straight tracks thus easy to associate and or determine the 3D profile.
